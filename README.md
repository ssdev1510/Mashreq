Automation 

Hi Colleagues,

I have created automation script for homepage and contact us page.
I didnot get much time to complete the assigment, but able to complete 70-80% of assigment.

To run the script- I didnot use the maven build tool, so you need to add selenium standalone jar and testNg jar in buildpath.
You can find the selenium keywords in common package, test logic in java package, and test scenarios in test pacakge.

I didnot get much bandwidth, if you say I can find some more time today or tommorow to properly test and complete the assignment.

Thanks,
Sahil Singla
